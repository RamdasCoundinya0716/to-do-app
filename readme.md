Absolutely! Here's a comprehensive README file that combines the code, Docker setup, and clear instructions for beginners:

**Daily To-Do List App with Streamlit & Docker**

This project creates a simple web-based to-do list app that resets daily. It uses Streamlit for the interface and Docker for easy deployment.

**Features**

*   Add tasks
*   Mark tasks as done
*   Automatically resets the list at midnight every day
*   Displays the current date and day of the week

**Prerequisites**

*   Docker installed on your system (for deployment)
*   Basic understanding of Python and command line

**Project Files**

*   `todo_app.py`: Contains the main Python code for the app
*   `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building a Docker image to run the app

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Set Up Your Environment:**

    *   Make sure you have Docker installed. You can download it from [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2.  **Get the Project Code:**

    *   Clone this repository to your computer:
        ```bash
        git clone https://your-repository-url.git
        cd your-repository-name
        ```

3.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    *   Open a terminal in the project directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located).
    *   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        docker build -t daily-todo-app .
        ```
    *   This will take some time as it downloads the necessary components and builds the image.

4.  **Run the Docker Container:**

    *   After the build finishes, start the app:
        ```bash
        docker run -p 8501:8501 daily-todo-app
        ```

5.  **Access the App:**

    *   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`. 
    *   You should see the To-Do List app!

**Using the App**

1.  **Add a Task:** Type your task into the text box and click "Add Task."
2.  **Mark as Done:** Check the box next to a task to mark it as complete.
3.  **Automatic Reset:** The to-do list will automatically clear at midnight each day.

**Code Explanation (`todo_app.py`)**

*   **`reset_todo_list()`:** Checks if it's a new day. If so, resets the to-do list.
*   **`add_task()`:**  Handles adding new tasks.
*   **`update_task_status()`:**  Changes a task's completion status.
*   **`display_todo_list()`:** Shows the current tasks.
*   **`display_date()`:** Displays the date and day.
*   **`main()`:** The core function that runs the app.

**Understanding the Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir streamlit

# Expose the port that Streamlit uses
EXPOSE 8501

# Command to run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "todo_app.py"]
```

*   `FROM`: Specifies the base image. We're using a slim Python version.
*   `WORKDIR`: Sets the directory where commands will run inside the container.
*   `COPY`: Copies your code into the container.
*   `RUN`: Installs the `streamlit` package.
*   `EXPOSE`: Tells Docker to make port 8501 accessible from outside.
*   `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

**Troubleshooting**

*   **Port Conflicts:** If you get an error about port 8501 being in use, try a different port (e.g., 8502) and change the `-p` flag in the `docker run` command accordingly.
*   **Missing Dependencies:** Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed inside the Docker container. The `RUN pip install...` line in the `Dockerfile` should take care of this.
